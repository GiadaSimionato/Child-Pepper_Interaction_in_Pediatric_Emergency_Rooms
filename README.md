# Child-Pepper Interaction in Pediatric Emergency Rooms

Project repository for the module Human-Robot Interaction of the course Elective In Artificial Intelligence, Sapienza University of Rome.

This repository contains the code for a short-term, multilingual, multimodal customized interactive system that is able to form social relationships between the Pepper robot, by Softbanks, and children in pediatric emergency rooms.

This work was completed on July 19th, 2020.
